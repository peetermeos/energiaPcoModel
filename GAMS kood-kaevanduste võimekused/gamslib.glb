Area of Hexagon Test Problem  (HIMMEL16,SEQ=36)

The physical problem is to maximize the area of a hexagon in which the diameter must be less than or equal to one. The formulation in Himmelblau is different from the one given here, because certain fixed variables have been eliminated. However, the formulation given here is more natural and easier to understand.  It makes use of the fact that one vertex is fixed at the origin and uses the vector scalar product to calculate the areas of all triangles originating from the origin. All terms in x(1) and y(1) thus vanish when the algebraic expression is simplified.

The problem appears many other places, e.g. as example 108 in W. Hock and K. Schittkowski: Test Examples for Nonlinear Programming Codes, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, 187, Springer Verlag, 1981, and as the test example in P. E. Gill, W. Murray, M. A.

An interesting problem is that due to inflexibility in production scheduling (as stated) in the petrochemical sector it is not possible to satisfy market requirements without producing excess amounts of certain products which then have to be disposed of.

The blending is done by recipe and quality specifications. All product flows are measured by weight. the original Platoform version does not give values for the research octane and viscosity blending formulas because of its proprietary nature. A simple functional form has been estimated from the Platoform results for illustrative purposes and the lower specification of "ron" for motor-gas had to be lowered from 99.3 to 99.0 in order to maintain feasibility.

This model finds all possible ways to arrange eight queens on a chess board in such a way that no two queens check against any other queen. The solution proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we find any solution. In the second step we find all solutions by adding cuts to to the original problem set. Finally, a reporting step is added to print all solutions found. This problem has a long history. In 1850 it was investigated by C.F. Gauss, but he was unable to solve it completely. There are 92 possible solutions.

Soldiers can be enlisted for 1, 2, 3 or 4 years, and the decision is how many soldiers to enlist for each enlistment period in each year.

This problem can be formulated using stock or flow variables. Four different formulations are presented here. The most readable formulation is the one using a stock variable. Although requiring more variables, the stock formulation has fewer nonzero entries in the matrix and is also preferred from a computational point of view.

Minimum and maximum trade constraints are added to the standard mean-variance model. If it is not profitable to trade within these ranges, no trade should take place. A turnover constraint is added to improve stability of the solution to small changes in data. The resulting model is a nonlinear mixed-integer problem.

Two important modeling tricks are demonstrated: (1) use of only the triangular part of the Q matrix, and (2) introduction of the marginal variance to improve computational performance of large QP problems.

Sample Program Comparing GAMS/MCP and GAMS/MPSGE Formulations

This program contains two presentations of an open-economy general equilibrium model.  The first employs MILES/MCP for a model expressed with equations written in standard GAMS algebra.  The second version of the model is expressed with MPSGE tables.  The equations for the MPSGE version are generated automatically.

Both model formulations illustrate the manner in which Armington and Heckscher-Ohlin imports can be mixed in the same model.

Solution values for this sample dataset are intuitive.  Exemptions reduce the "economic burden" of the tax, but they may also completely contradict the stated purpose of the energy tax (i.e., with tax exemptions to energy-intensive industry, energy demand may go up rather than down).

A latin square is an arrangement of objects such that no object is repeated in a row or column. Two latin squares are orthogonal if all entries are different. For example,

        one     two
       1 3 2   2 1 3
       3 2 1   1 3 2
       2 1 3   3 2 1

The case of n=10 has historical interest and was only settled in 1952.

The original formulation is not correct. A new formulation is presented which generates a correct solution. Also note that the solution time is very sensitive to formulation details and depends on the kind of algorithm used.

The size of the square can easily by changed by editing the lines containing the definitions of the rows, columns and values in the. set definition below. This kind of assignment problem can be very difficult to solve for general purpose MIP codes.

Integer Cut Example (ICUT,SEQ=160)

Sometimes it may be required to exclude certain integer solutions. Additional constraints, called cuts, can be added to exclude such solutions. To exclude the k'th integer solution we can write:

    cut(k)..  sum(i, abs(x(i)-xsol(i,k)) =g= 1;

The absolute function has to be simulated using 0/1 variables and some additional constraints. When the solution to be excluded is at lower or upper bound, we do not need additional 0/1 variables.

In this example we simply show how to enumerate all possible combinations of four integer variables.

The problem consists of determining the product mix for a furniture shop with two workstations: carpentry and finishing. The availability of labor in man-hours at the two stations is limited. There are four product classes, each consuming a certain number of man-hours at the two stations. Each product earns a certain profit and the shop has the option to purchase labor from outside. The objective is to maximize the profit.

A refinery can blend raw materials into different products. At present, the management is trying to decide how much of each of the raw materials to purchase and stock, so that they can be blended to satisfy the demand for the products in future time periods. The demand has to be completely satisfied, and in case of raw material shortage the products can be outsourced at a higher cost. There is an inventory constraint on how much raw material can be stocked in total.

A farmer carrying a bushel of corn and accompanied by a goose and a wolf came to a river. He found a boat capable of transporting himself plus one of his possessions - corn, goose, or wolf - but no more. Now, he couldn't leave the corn alone with the goose, nor the goose alone with the wolf, else one would consume the other. Nevertheless, he succeeded in getting himself and his goods across the river safely.

  Length of the pipeline segments
  Diameter of pipeline segments
  Suction and discharge pressures at each stations

Cross Entropy SAM Estimation (CESAM,SEQ=228)

CESAM illustrates a cross entropy technique for estimating the cells of a consistent SAM assuming that the initial data are inconsistent and measured with error. The method is applied to a stylized macro SAM for Mozambique. Some macro control totals are assumed known with error, and also all the row and column totals are assumed known only with error. We assume that the user can specify a prior estimate of the standard error of the estimates of the row and column sums and of the macro control totals.

A refinery can blend raw materials into different products. At present, the management is trying to decide how much of each of the raw materials to purchase and stock, so that they can be blended to satisfy the demand for the products in future time periods. The demand has to be completely satisfied, and in case of raw material shortage the products can be outsourced at a higher cost. There is an inventory constraint on how much raw material can be stocked in total.

Exercise, p. 44:

The Clear Lake Dam controls the water level in Clear Lake, a well-known resort in Dreamland.  The Dam Commission is trying to decide how much water to release in each of the next four months. The Lake is currently 150 mm below flood stage.  The dam is capable of lowering the water level 200 mm each month, but additional precipitation and evaporation affect the dam.  The weather near Clear Lake is highly variable.  The Dam Commission has divided the months into two two-month blocks of similar weather.  The months within each block have the same probabilities for weather, which are assumed independent of one another.  In each month of the first block, they assign a probability of 1/2 to having a natural 100-mm increase in water levels and probabilities of 1/4 to having a 50-mm decrease or a 250-mm increase in water levels.  All these figures correspond to natural changes in water level without dam releases.  In each month of the second block, they assign a probability of 1/2 to having a natural 150-mm increase in water levels and probabilities of 1/4 to having a 50-mm increase or a 350-mm increase in water levels.  If a flood occurs, then damage is assessed at $10,000 per mm above flood level.  A water level too low leads to costly importation of water. These costs are $5000 per mm less than 250 mm below flood stage.  The commission first considers an overall goal of minimizing expected costs.  This model only considers this first objective.

The Pooling Problem (POOL,SEQ=254)

This model presents a number of pooling problems from the literature in a unified framework. It represents the pq-formulation as of the pooling problem described in:

M. Tawarmalani and N. V. Sahinidis, in "Convexification and Global Optimization of the Pooling Problem," May 2002, Mathematical Programming, submitted.

All 14 problems have known global solutions.

Summary reports across all 14 problems allow quick assessment of local and global solution methods. Also note the importance of good starting points for local solvers.

This model and the generic pq-formulation has been provided by Mohit Tawarmalani, August 2002.

This test problem locates points in the unit square such that the distance between any two points is maximized. For certain number of points we know optimal arrangements. This knowledge is also used to find a lower bound on the objective by looking for perfect square arrangements (suggested by S Dirkse).

Several formulations are presented which serve as good examples to investigate the performance of different solution approaches. The problem was originally proposed by Dick van Hertog and has been implemented by Janos Pinter and used extensively by LGO with 13 and 20 points.

This test problem is due to J Pinter. A Drud has pointed out that solvers using derivatives will have a hard time with this model. There is a primal solution but the dual does not exist and the global solution does not satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. sqr(x) = 0 implies x=0, but the marginal on this constraint is usually infinite and the solution depends wildly on any finite tolerance. This model can be reformulated as shown by Drud. His reformulation is given below.

The global solutions is x(i) = 0.

The Five Leaper Tour Problem (FIVELEAP,SEQ=268)

Just as the knight makes moves of length root-5 that have coordinates {1,2}, a fiveleaper is a type of generalized knight that makes moves of length 5 units, with coordinates either {0,5} or {3,4}. In either event the Euclidean distance traveled is five squares.

A tour requires that the fiveleaper visits every square on a board once and once only using legal moves. The start and finish squares must be separated by a legal move and the fiveleaper could close the tour by making this final move.

Run with parameters NROW, NCOL (size of chess board, default 8x8), and MAXCUT (maximum number of subtour elimination cuts, default 500). For example,

gams fiveleap --NROW=10 --NCOL=10 --MAXCUT=1000

A non-cooperative game: Nash and Stackelberg versions (NASH,SEQ=269)

The original formulation is as a non-cooperative game; a Nash equilibrium is sought.  The Nash game is then extended to a Stackelberg or leader-follower game.  The Stackelberg game differs from the original Nash game in that one firm (the leader) now anticipates the prices set by all the other firms (the followers) and sets its own prices based on this information.

This problem computes minimal cost solutions satisfying the demand of pre-given product portfolios. It determines the number and size of reactors and gives a schedule of how may batches of each product run on each reactor. There are two scenarios (s1 20 products. s2 40 products), add --scenario s2 as a GAMS parameter to specify the second scenario.

The global optimal reactor volumes are: data set s1 vr.fx('r1') = 132.5; vr.fx('r2') = 250;

data set s2 vr.fx('r1') = 20; vr.fx('r2') = 100; vr.fx('r3') = 250;

Two formulations are presented, a compact MINLP formulations and a linearized MIP formulation using special ordered sets.

For the original model in quadratic programming format

   http://www.gams.com/modlib/adddocs/qp1doc.htm

The quadratic component x^T*CoVar(s,t)*x is modeled as:

(|d|-1)*x^T*CoVar(s,t)*x = x^Tdev(s,d)^T*dev(t,d)*x = ||Dx||^2
                         = sum(d, w_i^2) with w = Dx
                        := 2*p*q

which leads to the formulation in this model whose last constraint is a rotated quadratic cone.

Non-transitive Dice Design - Enhanced (DICEX,SEQ=272)

Robert A Bosh, suggested in a recent Optima Newsletter an extension to the original DICE (SEQ=176) model: Each number on a face can appear only once. This has been formulated by adding the 0/1 variable fmap and equations eq4 (to define the mapping of values to faces) and eq5 (to make this mapping unique). Note the importance of the '=e=' type in equation eq1 and the power of eq3.

Probabilistic dice - an example of a non-transitive relation. We want to design a set of dice with an integer number on each face such that on average dice1 beats dice2, and dice2 on average beats dice3 etc, but diceN has to beat dice1.

This is a mini mean-variance portfolio selection problem described in 'GAMS/MINOS: Three examples' by Alan S. Manne, Department of Operations Research, Stanford University, May 1986.

Integer variables have been added to restrict the number of securities selected. The resulting MINLP problem is solved with different option settings to demonstrate some DICOPT features. Finally, the model is solved by complete enumeration using GAMS procedural facilities.

Nonlinear Simple Agricultural Sector Model (QDEMO7,SEQ=284)

This is a QCP version of the gamslib model DEMO7. The original NLP formulation was concerned with good starting points. QCPs do not need starting a point.

This is the last in a series of agricultural farm level and sector models, this model simulates the market behavior of the sector using a partial equilibrium framework. The technique is the maximization of consumers and producers surplus.

Rounding Problems in MIPs (BADMIP,SEQ=290)

Most mixed-integer solvers are based on linear programming engines which use floating-point arithmetic. Occasionally, this leads to wrong solutions. Many MIP solvers failed on this example.

Neumaier and Shcherbina have suggested procedures to overcome this problem. It should be the MIP below has a feasible space which is one single point only and the relaxed solution is far away from the integer solution. Most MIP codes will fail when the upper bound of the variables are large. In practice, this can be overcome by using tight upper bounds on integer variables to get a good relaxation. Looking at the relaxed problem will give more insight.

Minimum and maximum trade constraints are added to the standard mean-variance model. If it is not profitable to trade within these ranges, no trade should take place. A turnover constraint is added to improve stability of the solution to small changes in data. The resulting model is now expressed as a MIQCP and a frontiers is computed.

Julian date test (JDATE,SEQ=292)

The gams function JDate(year,month,day) accepts arguments similar to to date functions in other languages. The earliest date is Jan 1, 1, and the latest date is Dec 31, 9999. Gams picked Jan 1, 1900 as day 1, as done by Excel. Unfortunately, Excel treats the year 1900 incorrectly as a leap year and the serial days starting with March 1, 1900 will be off by one day.

The arguments are can be positive or negative and do not have to form a proper date. The arguments with fractional values are first converted to a signed integer by using the floor() function.

Note about Excel: The Excel DATE(year,month,day) function has the following data ranges note that excel incorrectly treats the year 1900 as a leap year.
 DATE(1900, 1, 1) =        1
 DATE(1900, 2,28) =       59
 DATE(1900, 3, 1) =       61 incorrect; should be 60
 DATE(9999,12,31) =  2958465 incorrected; should be 2958464
for years having a value of less than 1900, 1900 + year is assumed

The wiki at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day defines the Julian date (JD) as the interval of time in days and fractions of a day since January 1, 4713 BC Greenwich noon. For example JD values are:
   Sunday January 14, 2007 at 13:18:59.9'  JD = 2454115.05486
The GAMS days start with 1/1/1900 00:00:00 which giveds an offset of 2415019.500

The following table shows different ways of entering dates:

This file is the result of a routine process to take a raw file from a web site and attach custom labels to rows and columns ( http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn2/i-o_benchmark.htm ).  The rows and columns have the form '<number> space <text>'. Some of the rows have been dropped and the <number> on the row labels does not match the corresponding column label.  Note that the row named Air2 has number 503, whereas the column Air2 has number 513.  Since the aggregations are done by column numbers, the row numbers need to be reassigned to use the column order. Furthermore, there are three row labels that have no matching column labels.

Finally, the matrix needs to be aggregated from a size of 513 to a much smaller size.

We use the unix tool SED to manipulate the text files into a format suitable to be read by GAMS. For more details on SED please an SED book.

This is a small GAMS program which formulates a simple exchange model with multiple households and shows how the model can be solved either in "bottom-up" mode (with an explicit representation of the consumer demands in the model) or through successive computation of a "top-down" model.

The default configuration of this model has 1000 households.  The program output is the reporting parameter itrlog which should be displayed as follows:

This program takes raw data from an Excel sheet, transforms the data and finds the optimal values for alpha and beta following a procedure outlined by Stephen Wright. An integral is computed numerically using a trapezoidal approximations. The optimization results are then written back into the Excel file.

This procedure was originally coded by David O'Brochta in Mathematica and recast in a GAMS optimization framework by Wilhelmine Meeraus.

The Excel file contains the data from the field and labwork described in W Meeraus, 2004.

The closest-string problem (CSP) finds a center string that minimizes the Hamming distance between the center string and all other strings. The Hamming distance counts the nonmatching characters. For example, 'CATCC' and 'CTTGC' have a Hamming distance of 2.

Three formulations are presented. Formulations 1 and 2 can only be used for small problems. Formulation 3 is the most intuitive formulation and works well with general purpose MIP codes.

It should be noted that the root node heuristic of CPLEX performs very well. With an absolute gap of one or two, CPLEX finds solution within a few seconds for all suggested sizes. For example, the setting below will result in solutions that are either within 1.0 from he global optimum or less than 1 percent:

option optcr=0.01, optca=1.99;

License Memorandum (LICEMEMO,SEQ=307)

This model generates a license memorandum with all licensed components and available subsystems.

When you purchase GAMS you buy components like the BASE component, solver components like CONOPT, and GAMS language extension components like MPSGE. Each licensed component enables you to run the associated subsystems (mostly solvers). Each licensed component comes with an expiration and a maintenance date. Subsystems corresponding to a licensed component will stop working after the expiration date. GAMS distributions that are not newer then the maintenance date will allow you to run the subsystems associated with the component in full mode.

This is an example of how to model material extractions that have sequencing requirements with a multi-period decision process. A segment has to be extracted completely before we can start on the next segment. Segments not completely extracted have to be extracted in the next time period or remain partially extracted in the last time period. The requirement of full extraction adds complications to the modeling within the multi-period framework.

Controlled Tabular Adjustments (CTA) is a recent method to limit disclosure and can be elegantly expressed as a Mixed Integer Programming problem.

Given a sequence of 0 & 1 observations,  {c(t)}, We wish to find the linear recursive sequence defined by:

   k(t) = k(t-n) xor k(t-(n-r))    (mod 2),   for t = n+1,2, ... t

that minimizes the number of disagreements between c(t) and k(t).

note, once k(1), k(2), ..., k(n) are specified, then k(n+1), ..., k(t) are uniquely determined by the lrs.

Thus, this model declares k(1), k(2), ..., k(n) as binary and k(t), t > n as continuous variables that will automatically assume binary values when k(1) thru k(n) are binary.

This model is based on a client model from the area of cryptography.

The model demonstrates the use of variablename.prior=INF to relax some elements of a discrete variable to fractional variable elements. Moreover, it shows how to formulate the logical XOR operator using mixed-integer linear programming.

Similar to compression, we offer an $encrypt utility to lock any file to a specific target license file. Once a file has been encrypted it can only be read by a gams program that has the matching license file.  There is no inverse operation possible: you cannot recover the original GAMS file from the encrypted version.

To create an encrypted file, we need a license file which has the security option enabled. To allow easy testing and demonstration a special temporary demo license can be created internally and will be valid for a limited time only, usually one to two hours.

In the following example we will use the GAMS option license=DEMO to use a demo license with secure option instead of our own license file. Also note that we use the same demo license file to read the locked file by specifying the GAMS parameter plicence=LICENSE.

eps-Constraint Method for Multiobjective Optimization (EPSCM,SEQ=319)

The eps-Constraint Method

This is a GAMS implementation of the augmented eps-constraint method for generating the efficient (Pareto optimal, nondominated) solutions in multiobjective problems. The eps-constraint method optimizes one of the objective functions using the remaining objective functions as constraints, varying their right hand side.

The generated optimal solutions proved to be efficient solutions of the multiobjective problem under certain conditions.

The eps-constraint method consists of two phases: 1. Creation of the payoff table 2. Use the ranges from the payoff table in order to apply the method

The augmented eps-constraint uses lexicographic optimization in the construction of the payoff table (in order to secure the Pareto optimality of the individual optima) and a slightly modified objective function in order to ensure the production of Pareto optimal (and not weakly Pareto optimal) solutions. In addition, it performs early exit from infeasible loops improving the performance of the algorithm in multi-objective problems with several objective functions.

The algorithm can work also with MIP models. Actually the advantages of the eps-constraint method over the weighting method are more apparent for MIP problems where the non supported Pareto optimal solutions can be produced.

A simplified power generation problem is used to illustrate the method:

Four types of power generation units are considered in a region, namely, lignite fired, oil fired, natural gas fired and units exploiting renewable energy sources (RES) which are mostly small hydro and wind.  The power generation characteristics of these units are shown in table pdata.

The yearly demand is 64000 GWh and is characterized by a load duration curve which can be divided into three type of loads: base load (60%), medium load (30%) and peak load (10%). The lignite fired units can be used only for base and middle load, the oil fired units for middle and peak load, the RES units for base and peak load and the natural gas fired units for all type of loads. The endogenous sources are lignite and RES.

We consider three objective functions: the minimization of production cost, the minimization of CO2 emissions and the minimization of external dependence (i.e. oil and natural gas) by maximizing the endogenous energy sources.  The task is to generate the payoff table and the Pareto optimal (efficient, non-dominated) solutions of the problem.

Kissing Number Problem using Variable Neighborhood Search (KNP,SEQ=321)

Determining the maximum number of k-dimensional spheres of radius r that can be adjacent to a central sphere of radius r is known as the Kissing Number Problem (KNP). The problem has been solved for 2 (6), 3 (12) and very recently for 4 (24) dimensions. Here is a nonlinear (nonconvex) mathematical programming model known as the distance formulation for the solution of the KNP. We solve the problem by using the Variable Neighbourhood Search Algorithm.

Termination routine to ensure solvers stay with resource limit (SCHULZ,SEQ=322)

Sometimes experimental solvers do not terminate in the prespecified time limit or at all. Running batches of models with such a solver (e.g. for performance testing) requires frequent attention (to terminate the hanging process). This little GAMS program scans the list of processes and checks if the CPU time exceedes the preset limit. If the time is exceeded 'schulz' sends a terminate signal to the process.

gams schulz --watch ^gms --res 1010 --sleep 60

--watch the process names to watch (argument is a regular expression)

--res   the maximum time available to a watched process before sending a
        termination signal. (in seconds)

--sleep frequency of checking processes (in seconds)

The parameters in the example call of 'schulz' represent the defaults for the options.

Mission Planning for Synthetic Aperture Radar Surveillance (SWATH,SEQ=325)

The Microwave Radar Division of the Defence Sciences and Technology Organisation employs synthetic aperture radar to obtain high-resolution images of selected ground targets. It uses this device, mounted on an aircraft, to scan up to 20 rectangular regions called swaths to obtain images with resolutions down to one meter. Missions consisting of a designated sequence of swaths and flight paths are planned using mapping software. Previously DSTO had been determining the best tours for missions by visually tracking possible swath sequences from a starting base to an ending base. This method was time consuming and did not guarantee optimality interms of distance traveled. We developed optimization software tools to plan mission tours more efficiently. DSTO can now plan missions with up to 20 swaths in a few seconds, rather than the hour it took using the visual approach. Proposed tour lengths show an average improvement of 15 percent over those manually produced. The software incorporates methods for dealing with the operational problems of no-fly zones and shadowing associated with images.

Once a job has started it cannot be interrupted. The objective is to obtain the sequence of task, which minimizes the completion time.

This model solves a jobshop scheduling, which has a set of jobs (5) which must be processed in sequence of stages (5) but not all jobs require all stages. A zero wait transfer policy is assumed between stages. To obtain a feasible solution it is necessary to eliminate all clashes between jobs. It requires that no two jobs be performed at any stage at any time. The objective is to minimize the makespan, the time to complete all jobs.

Let G(N, E) denote a graph. A cut is a partition of the vertices N into two sets S and T. Any edge (u,v) in E with u in S and v in T is said to be crossing the cut and is a cut edge. The size of the cut is defined to be sum of weights of the edges crossing the cut.

This model presents a simple MIP formulation of the problem that is seeded with a solution from the Goemans/Williamson randomized approximation algorithm based on a semidefinite programming relaxation.

This model solves the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP) using different convexification methods. The GQAP describes a broad class of quadratic integer programming problems, wherein I pair-wise related equipments are assigned to N locations constrained by the locations' ability to accommodate them.

Cplex has a build-in convexification method for MIQPs when the quadratic terms involve binary variables only. The other methods require the solution of a semidefinite program.  The communication with the SDP solver is done through ASCII files.

We discuss a portfolio optimization problem occurring in the energy market. Energy distributing public services have to decide how much of the requested energy demand has to be produced in their own power plant, and which complementary amount has to be bought from the spot market and from load following contracts.

This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and implemented in GAMS. The formulation is applied to real data of a German electricity distributor.

Convexification of bilinear term binary times x (BILINEAR,SEQ=346)

The model demonstrates various forumlations to represent bilinear product terms of one continuous and one binary variable.

A set of 60 products i is produced on a set of machine with a given total capacity. Some machine are special in the sense that if a product is produced on one of them, cleaning treatment costs apply caused by a set of cleaning treatment machines t.

A binary variable, delta(i), indicates that product i is produced on one of the special machines. The model is simplified regarding the machine-product relations.

Here we mimic a larger roduction problem, and just require that

     E1.. sum(iE, delta(iE)) =e= 2 ;
     E2.. sum(iO, delta(iO)) =e= 5 ;

which represents the fact that it cannot be avoided to use the special machine and, thus, to have some cleaning treatment.

If product i is produced on a special machine, then the amount, y(i), of the by-product is given by the recipe constraint y(i)=0.164*p(i), where the non-negative variable p(i) is the amount produced on special machines. For each product there is a specific yield of YS(i) $/ton. The by-product is burnt and leads to an energy yield of YB(i) $/ton, where YB(i)<YS(i). The by-product also passes the treatment plant.

The production is limited by the production capacity C, where x(i), 100+i <= x(i) <= XUB, is the amount of product i produced.

The amount produced on special machines is p(i)=x(i)*delta(i).

We compare the non-convex MINLP formulation to equivalent linear forms of p(i)=x(i)*delta(i) using big-M, convex hull, and indicator forumlations.  Moreover, a new SOS-1 formulation is presented which is described in:

A Transportation Problem with discretized economies of scale (TRNSPWL,SEQ=351)

This problem finds a least cost shipping schedule that meets requirements at markets and supplies at factories. This instance applies economies of scale which results in a non-convex objective. This is an extension of the trnsport model in the GAMS Model Library.

The original nonlinear term is "sum((i,j), c(i,j)*sqrt(x(i,j)))". We use the following discretization f(x) of sqrt(x)

  For x<=50:  f(x) = 1/sqrt(50)*x,
  for x>=400: f(x) = (sqrt(600)-sqrt(400))/200*(x-400) + sqrt(400)
  in between we discretize with linear interpolation between points

This discretization has some good properties:
  0) f(x) is a continuous function
  1) f(0)=0, otherwise we would pick up a fixed cost even for unused connections
  2) a fine representation in the reasonable range of shipments (between 50 and 400)
  3) f(x) underestimates sqrt in the area of x=0 to 600. Past that is overestimates sqrt.

The model is organized as follows:
  1) We set a starting point for the NLP solver so it will get stuck
     in local optimum that is not the global optimum.

  2) We use three formulations for representing piecewise linear
     functions all based on the same discretization.

     a) a formulation with SOS2 variables. This formulation mainly is
        based on the convex combination of neighboring
        points. Moreover, the domain of the discretization can be
        unbounded: we can assign a slope in the (potentially
        unbounded) first and last segment.

     b) a formulation with SOS2 variables based on convex combinations
        of neighboring points. This formulation requires a bounded
        region for the discretization. Here we discretize between 0 and
        600.

     c) a formuation with binary variables. This also requires the
        domain to be bounded, but it does not rely on the convex
        combination of neighboring points. There are examples, where
        this formulation solves much faster than the formulation b).

     In this example x is clearly bounded by 0 from below and
     min(smax(i,a(i),smax(j,b(j)) from above, so formulation b and c
     are sufficient and perform better on this particular model and
     instance. We added the formulation a to demonstrate how to model
     an unbounded discretization, in case there are no derived
     bounds. The formulation a can be easily adjusted to accommodate
     problems where only one end of the discretization is unbounded.

  3) We restart the non-convex NLP from the solution of the discretized
     model and hope that the NLP solver finds the global solution.

Food Manufacturing Problem - Blending of oils  (FOOD,SEQ=352)

The problem is to plan the blending of five kinds of oil, organized in two categories (two kinds of vegetable oils and three kinds of non vegetable oils) into batches of blended products over six months.

Some of the oil is already available in storage. There is an initial stock of oil of 500 tons of each raw type when planning begins. An equal stock should exist in storage at the end of the plan. Up to 1000 tons of each type of raw oil can be stored each month for later use. The price for storage of raw oils is 5 monetary units per ton. Refined oil cannot be stored. The blended product cannot be stored either.

The rest of the oil (that is, any not available in storage) must be bought in quantities to meet the blending requirements. The price of each kind of oil varies over the six-month period.

The two categories of oil cannot be refined on the same production line. There is a limit on how much oil of each category (vegetable or non vegetable) can be refined in a given month:
 - Not more than 200 tons of vegetable oil can be refined per month.
 - Not more than 250 tons of non vegetable oil can be refined per month.

There are constraints on the blending of oils:
 - The product cannot blend more than three oils.
 - When a given type of oil is blended into the product, at least 20 tons of
   that type must be used.
 - If either vegetable oil 1 (v1) or vegetable oil 2 (v2) is blended in the
   product, then non vegetable oil 3 (o3) must also be blended in that product.

The final product (refined and blended) sells for a known price: 150 monetary units per ton.

The aim of the six-month plan is to minimize production and storage costs while maximizing profit.

Huts or villages are located at 20 location on a 10 x 10 grid. The problem is to find the two best drop locations for relief packages such that the total distance traveled by villagers is minimized.

We look at this problem as a plant location problem and trace the efficiency frontier of multiple drops. The optimal solution for two drops is D.8 and E.2.

Another interesting question may be: how many other drop locations are there that have a total distance traveled with, say, 3 percent of the best location.

Multi-stage Stochastic Water Reservoir Model solved with SDDP (SDDP,SEQ=357)

The Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm for solving multi-stochastic linear programs uses, similar to the well known Benders decomposition, the concept of a future cost function (FCF). The algorithm works with an underestimate approximation of this FCF by iterativley adding supporting hyperplanes (Benders cuts) and therefore improving the approximation.

This implementation uses Gather-Update-Solve-Scatter (GUSS) in GAMS making the many related solves efficient. An implementation using traditional loops can be found at:

http://www.gams.com/modlib/adddocs/sddp_trad.gms

This SDDP algorithm has been implemented using IBM Ilog's Concert Technology (Version 12.2). The C++ source code is available at

http://www.gams.com/modlib/adddocs/sddp.cpp

The data and core model has been provided by Vattenfall Energy Trading.

Three-dimensional Noughts and Crosses Multiple Solutions (CUBESOLN,SEQ=371)

White and black balls are to be arranged in a cube one to a cell in such a way as to minimize the number of lines with balls of equal color. For this example the length of the cube is three. a total of 49 lines exist in a cube of 3x3x3. 27 lines by changing only one coordinate, 18 diagonals within a plane, and 4 diagonals going across planes.

This variation of the model uses a simple "binary cut" to eliminate a solution so a subsequent solve produces an alternative solution. This is done in a loop to produce altenative solutions. It also uses Cplex' solution pool facility to generate multiple solutions.

There are many symmetries in the cube model so both procedures find multiple optimal solutions.

Global optimization of semi-infinite programs via restriction of the right-hand side (SIPRES,SEQ=372)

This model provides an algorithm for the global solution of a semi-infinite program (SIP) without convexity assumptions. It terminates finitely with a guaranteed feasible point, and a certificate of eps^f-optimality. The only assumptions are continuity of the functions and existence of an eps^f-optimal SIP-Slater point. The lower and upper bounds are obtained by the solution of two nonconvex nonlinear programs (NLP) each, thus shifting the nonconvexity to the global NLP solver.

This example provides a solution to the SIP

min{(x_1,x_2) in [-1000,1000]^2} 1/3*sqr(x_1) + sqr(x_2) + 1/2*x_1; s.t.
 sqr(1-sqr(x_1)*sqr(y)) - x_1*sqr(y)-sqr(x_2) + x_2 <= 0 for all y in [0,1]

Finding Optimal Breakpoints when linearizing a power utility function (SEQ=373)

A power utility function with constant relative risk aversion is often used in economic and financial modelling. It may be desired, for computational reasons, to linearize this function when it is used together with constraints requiring integer variables. This model finds the optimal breakpoints for such a linearization for a given interval.

The system.PowerSetLeft and system.PowerSetRight are predefined procedures to create a three dimensional set xxx(n,s,b) which can be interpreted as a numbering system with base b and s digits. The total number of tuples is power(card(b),card(s)).

With PowerSetLeft the index on the left changes first. With PowerSetRight the index on the right changes first.

Here is simple 2 x 2 example:

sets n / n1*n4 /, s / s0,s1 /, b / 0,1 /,

Linearization techniques for extremal-Nash equilibria  (LINEARNE,SEQ=382)

This model proposes a new approach to the computation of extremal-Nash equilibria in a wholesale power market with transmission constraints. The approach uses linearization techniques to formulate the extremal-Nash equilibrium problem as a single-stage mixed-integer linear programming problem which can be solved with standard software. Through the introduced concept of extremal-Nash equilibria, the derived structure can efficiently locate all Nash equilibria of the game.

This example is loosely based on the NSW market. There are 7 portfolios each controlling 2 units.

Improved version of eps-Constraint Method for Multiobjective Optimization  (EPSCMMIP,SEQ=384)

The Augmented Epsilon Constraint Method version 2 (AUGMECON2) The method is applied to a Multi-Objective Integer Programming problem (specifically a Multi-Objective Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem) with 50 binary variables X, 2 objective functions and 2 constraints

The AUGMECON2 can be used to generate the exact Pareto set (all the Pareto optimal solutions) if the step size (i.e.the interval between the grid points of the objective functions that are used as constraints) is appropriately chosen. For problems with integer objective function coeffcients the step size should be at most equal to unity.

The exact Pareto set of the specific problem consists of 35 Pareto optimal solutions. The solution time is approximately 4 secs on a 2012 machine. The gridpoints are set to 491 = the second objective function range. The output file 2kp50_augmecon2_results.txt contains the payoff table, the gridpoints and the Pareto optimal solutions. The indication "jump" is used to flag when one or more grid points are skipped.

The model is separable. The first part of the model (till line 129) is the problem description and the second part (from line 130) is the implementation of the method

A formulation with 0/1 variables is shown in the original gamslib model BID, one with SOS2 sets in gamslib model bidsos. Here we use segments with a point, length, and slope to define a model.

A Transportation Problem with Piecewise Linear Functions (TRNSPWLX,SEQ=386)

This problem finds a least cost shipping schedule that meets requirements at markets and supplies at factories. This instance applies economies of scale which results in a non-convex objective. This is an extension of the trnsport model in the GAMS Model Library.

The original nonlinear term is "sum((i,j), c(i,j)*sqrt(x(i,j)))". We use the following discretization f(x) of sqrt(x)

  For x<=50:  f(x) = 1/sqrt(50)*x,
  for x>=400: f(x) = 1/(2*sqrt(400))*(x-400) + sqrt(400)
  in between we discretize with linear interpolation between points

The model is organized as follows:
  1) We set a starting point for the NLP solver so it will get stuck
     in local optimum that is not the global optimum.

  2) We use the generic pwlfunc.inc batinclude to get a piecewise linear
     MIP formulation to get close to the global optimum.

  3) We restart the non-convex NLP from the solution of the discretized
     model and hope that the NLP solver finds the global solution.

This model is based on the model trnspwl in the GAMS Model Library

Find a solution to the system of nonlinear equations x-sin(2x+3y)-cos(3x-5y)=0 y-sin(x-2y)+cos(x+3y)=0.

This is a 2-variable, 2-constraint global optimization test problem in itself that could have (in fact, it has) multiple solutions. Therefore we will determine the minimal norm solution and iteratively increase the lower bound on the objective.

Stable Marriage Problem (STABLEM,SEQ=389)

Given a set of n men and n women, marry them off in pairs after each man has ranked the women in order of preference from 1 to n, {w_1,...,w_n} and each women has done likewise, {m_1,...,m_n}. If the resulting set of marriages contains no pairs of the form {m_i,w_j}, {m_k,w_l} such that m_i prefers w_l to w_j and w_l prefers m_i to m_k, the marriage is said to be stable. Gale and Shapley (1962) showed that a stable marriage exists for any choice of rankings (Skiena 1990, p. 245). In the United States, the algorithm of Gale and Shapley (1962) is used to match hospitals to medical interns (Skiena 1990, p. 245).

This model generates multiple/all solution by introducing MIP cuts and resolving the MIP.

Prisoners dilemma as EMP and MCP  (prisoner,SEQ=392)

Two criminals are caught and held in separate cells, unable to communicate with each other.  They are each offered the same deal, independently, and each knows that the other is offered this deal. They each have two options:
   1) confess and be a witness against the other person, or
   2) deny their guilt.
If they both confess, they will each get 5 years in jail.  If one confesses and the other denies guilt, then the one who confessed will get 1 year in jail and the other will get 6 years in jail. If they both deny guilt, they will each get 2 years in jail.

This problem is a good example of a two-person nonzerosum bimatrix game, as described in Cottle, Pang, and Stone.  The Prisoner's Dilemma has been posed and studied in various forms by many game theory researchers.  It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher at RAND in 1950 and formalized with prison sentence rewards as the Prisoner's Dilemma by Al Tucker.

Note that the KKT conditions for the two players' optimization problems contain free variables: the duals to the sum-to-one constraints.  This is not a problem for the mixed complementarity format used by GAMS, but it requires some algebraic gymnastics to create a problem that fits into the LCP framework, as described in CPS.

Cross Entropy SAM Estimation (CESAM2,SEQ=393)

CESAM2 illustrates a cross entropy technique for estimating the cells of a consistent SAM assuming that the initial data are inconsistent and measured with error. The method is applied to estimate the macro SAM used in CESAM.GMS. Cell elements, some macro control totals, and row and column totals are assumed to be measured with error. We assume that the user can specify prior estimates of the values and standard errors of measurement for the cell values, macro control totals, and row and column sums.

The original version of this code, CESAM.GMS, assumed that the SAM column coefficients, A(i,j) = SAM(i,j)/SUM(i, SAM(i,j)), are treated as analogous to probabilities and are included directly in the cross-entropy minimand. In this version each SAM element, SAM(i,j), is assumed to be measured with error, and all the errors are treated as probability-weighted sums of error support sets. Only probabilities are included in the cross-entropy minimand, which is consistent with the information-theoretic Bayesian approach to estimate probabilities. The cost of this approach is that in CESAM2 there are many more probabilities to be estimated. However, new solution algorithms are able to solve large problems of this type, so size is no longer a serious constraint.

In the estimation procedure, we assume prior information on either:
 (1) values of cells, SAM(i,j), or
 (2) coefficients, A(i,j).

Errors can be treated as either:
 (1) additive [e.g., SAM(i,j) = sam0(i,j) + err(i,j)], or
 (2) multiplicative [e.g., A(i,j) = abar0(i,j)*EXP(err(i,j))]

where sam0(i,j) and abar0(i,j) are prior values of the cell value or coefficient, and err(i,j) is the estimated measurement error.

In the first case, the prior mean of the errors is assumed to be zero. In the second case, it will be one. In the first case, it is possible for the posterior estimated cell value to change sign from the prior, while in the second case the posterior estimated coefficient value can never change sign.

In the code below, we assume a prior on coefficients measured with multiplicative errors for selected SAM accounts defined by the set acoeff(i).

Note that it is important to scale the SAM. Ideally, the SAM being estimated should be scaled so that it does not contain values larger than about 1e3.

Note also that by default we use the GAMS intrinsic function centropy() in the objective definition.  If you define NOCENTROPY (e.g. by running with --NOCENTROPY=1 on the command line) the cross-entropy function is written explicitly using logs, etc.

A simple version of a facility location problem is used to show how the solution pool and the tools associated with it work. This example is taken from the Cplex 11 User's Manual (ILOG, Cplex 11 User's Manual, 2007)

A company is considering opening as many as four warehouses in order to serve nine different regions. The goal is to minimize the sum of fixed costs associated with opening warehouses as well as the various transportation costs incurred to ship goods from the warehouses to the regions.

Whether or not to open a warehouse is represented by binary variable ow. Whether or not to ship goods from warehouse i to region j is represented by binary variable oa.

Each region needs a specified amount of goods, and each warehouse can store only a limited quantity of goods. In addition, each region must be served by exactly one warehouse.

Triangular Graph Circle Packing (tricp,SEQ=395)

A circle packing is a collection of circles whose interiors are disjoint. The contact graph of a circle packing in the plane is always a planar graph, and the set of circle centers with the line segments connecting tangent circle centers forms a planar embedding of the contact graph.

The Koebe-Andreev-Thurston theorem states that also the converse is true: For every connected simple planar graph G, there is a circle packing in the plane whose contact graph is isomorphic to G.

We use a triangulation of n-3 random points in a triangle to construct circle packing instances. Note that similarities (translations, rotations, scalings) have to be excluded by fixing some coordinates or selecting suitable start values. In this way, nice geometric problems result for a complete subdivision solver:

Simple GUSS example (GUSSEX1,SEQ=398)

GUSS is a procedure that facilitates optimization of a collection of related problems modifying data in those problems. GUSS allows one to solve the collection of models in a single pass without needing repeated solves or a LOOP over multiple solves. GUSS is not really a solver but rather organizes and passes data to and from another LP, NLP, MIP etc solver. This is all done in a faster fashion than say when using multiple solves through the GAMS Loop command.

In particular GUSS runs the model repeatedly over user specified data for model parameters that collectively define alternative scenarios to be run. In doing this it repeatedly updates the base model with the altered scenario data, then solves the updated model for that scenario and saves user chosen results for each scenario.

GUSS was developed by Michael R. Bussieck, Michael C. Ferris, and Timo Lohmann. It is documented in http://www.gams.com/modlib/adddocs/gusspaper.pdf and in the GUSS section of the solver manual.

Use of GUSS for an existing model requires six steps

1. Definition of scenarios to run 2. Definition of parameters holding scenario specific data for the items
   in the model that to be changed
3. Definition of parameters that will hold scenario specific model results
   for the items that the user wished to save
4. Definition of a set that tells GUSS the scenarios to run, data to change
   and results to save
5. Modification of the solve statement to identify that scenarios will be run 6. Development of code to report the scenario results

These 6 steps are demonstrated used the simple transport model

Configuring text layout in table cells to minimize table height (TABLELAYOUT,SEQ=402)

The Automated Table Layout problem is a document processing issue.

Given a table with a number of rows and columns, into each cell you have to place some text. For each cell, a number of configurations on how to break the text into several lines is given, therefore it generates various rectangles of different width and height. Thus, each configuration yields different requirements on the height and width of the cell, and therefor on the height of the row and the width of the column that the cell belongs to. The column width needs to be the same for all cells in that column, thus it is given by the maximum width of the chosen configurations over all cells in that column. The same for the rows. Given the width of the page, the objective is to find a layout minimizing the total height of the table.
